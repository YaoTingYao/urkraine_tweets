      My name is <b>Yao-Ting Yao</b>. I am a second-year student in MS GIS. I LOVE to learn new tech and enjoy the moment when I debug and fix the problem. I am currently a RA in Clark Lab doing image classification and crosstab cleaning for Mangrove and Pond aquaculture across different country and temporal period. I am also writing my master thesis about cropland mapping in Zambia using UNet and DenseNet.

      Hi everyone! My name is <b>Lester Carver</b>. I am a second year MS GIS student. I have a background in international development, disability rights, and environmental justice. I am interested in how GIS data can be communicated in an accessible way and be used to advance community-led development and I’m passionate about all things data visualization. I’m currently working with the US Forest Service as a GIS Intern and am a graduate assistant for an Urban Studies Foundation project looking at using GIS tools in research on state violence.
